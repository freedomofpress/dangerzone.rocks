  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <div class="clearfix">
    <p>Dangerzone works like this: You give it a document that you don't know
      if you can trust (for example, an email attachment). Inside of a sandbox,
      Dangerzone converts the document to a PDF (if it isn't already one), and
      then converts the PDF into raw pixel data: a huge list of of RGB color
      values for each page. Then, Dangerzone takes this pixel data and converts
      it back into a PDF.</p>
