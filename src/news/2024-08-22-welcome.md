Welcome to the official Dangerzone blog. We will mainly cover:
- release announcements
- security updates (e.g., about code audits or vulnerabilities)
- articles related to document sanitization and Dangerzone's inner workings.

You can follow the blog in your feed reader of choice. If you have thoughts on topics to cover (or would like to draft a post yourself), please don't hesitate to get in touch via our [discussion forums](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/discussions).

Thank you for being part of the Dangerzone community!
