title: Dangerzone 0.9.0 released
version: 0.9.0

We're pleased to announce that Dangerzone 0.9.0 has been released. This release mostly includes stability improvements and security fixes, with a few new features.

If you are on a Mac or Windows, please also update Docker Desktop to version 4.40.0 or later, as previous versions contain [known bugs](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/1101) that prevent Dangerzone from converting documents. On Windows, you will need to uninstall any Dangerzone version prior to 0.9.0 before installing this one.	

For this release, the highlights are:

- The container image is now reproducible across different container runtimes and versions ([#1074](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/1074)). As part of this effort, the image used to run the conversion is now based on Debian (it was previously based on Alpine Linux) ([#1046](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/1046)).  
- Outdated Docker Desktop versions are now highlighted in the user interface and the user is asked to upgrade ([#693](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/693)).  
- The CLI can now run with a `--debug` flag to help retrieve more logs ([#941](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/pull/941)).  
- Experimental support is now available for Podman Desktop on Windows and macOS ([docs](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/blob/main/docs/podman-desktop.md))
