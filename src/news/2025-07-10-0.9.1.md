We're pleased to announce that Dangerzone 0.9.1 has been released. It mainly
contains bug fixes for Windows and macOS platforms. If you are running Windows
or macOS, upgrading is advised as this release fixes errors with the latest
Docker Desktop version.

For this release, the highlights are:

- Uniformly enforce our seccomp profile when running the Dangerzone sandbox,
across all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) and container runtimes (Docker,
Podman). This fixes a regression that has manifested since Docker Desktop 4.42.0
([#1191](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/1191))
- Fix a conversion failure for users who have enabled Podman Desktop
integration, whereby the  Podman VM cannot find the necessary seccomp profile
([#1187](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/1187))

Thanks to [Nicola Sella](https://github.com/inknos) for updating the
installation instruction for Fedora
([#1176](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/pull/1176)).

This version drops support for Fedora 40, as security support has ended recently
([#1178](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/1178)).

[changelog](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#091).
