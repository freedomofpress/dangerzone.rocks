title: Dangerzone 0.10.0 released
version: 0.10.0

We're thrilled to announce the Dangerzone 0.10.0 release. It contains two big changes that we’ve been working on for the past few months:

1. **The Dangerzone sandbox that performs the document conversion can now auto-update** in the background, without having to install a new Dangerzone release. This allows us to push security fixes to all of our users in a timely fashion. It’s an opt-in feature that we strongly recommend you enable to greatly enhance your security. You can always choose to disable it if you prefer to update manually. Read more technical details about this feature [in our documentation](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/blob/main/docs/developer/independent-container-updates.md).

2. **Windows and macOS users no longer need to install and manage Docker Desktop separately**. Dangerzone now uses an open source container engine, [Podman](https://podman.io/), which is embedded directly in the macOS and Windows builds. You can now simply start Dangerzone, and let it install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (Windows only) and create the necessary virtual machines and sandboxes under the hood. Plus, if you are a user/IT administrator in a big organization that wants to install Dangerzone, but couldn’t due to the licensing limitations of Docker Desktop, you now can.

In addition to these two changes, here are some more release highlights:

* A new CLI helper called `dangerzone-machine` can help you manage the Podman virtual machine that Dangerzone uses under the hood ([#1172](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/1172)).  
* All the commands and their outputs are now captured, and you can see them from our user interface. Click on the hamburger menu (☰) → “View logs” and a window will open with these logs ([#1236](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/1236)).  
* The container image has been upgraded from Debian “bookworm” to Debian “trixie” ([#1243](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/1243)).  
* The bundled LibreOffice has been upgraded from version 7.x to 25.x, as a result of our Debian trixie switch ([#1165](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone/issues/1165)).
